# Created-Own-Library-using-OOPs

Practice OOPs - Statistical Analysis with Python
Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python to perform descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and data visualization.
It defines a class cal_stats that accepts a dataset (list/array) and provides multiple methods for analyzing and visualizing the data.

Features

The cal_stats class includes methods for:

Descriptive Statistics

Advanced Statistics

Visualization

Automatic detection of discrete vs continuous data

everything() â†’ Runs all methods sequentially for a dataset

Installation

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scipy

Usage

# Import dependencies

# Import class

# Sample dataset

# Create object

# Run full analysis

File Structure
Practice OOPs.ipynb   # Main notebook
README.md             # Project documentation

Notes

The project is designed for learning OOPs in Python with real-world statistical applications.

You can extend the cal_stats class to include hypothesis testing, regression, or other statistical models.
